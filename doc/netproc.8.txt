NAME
  netproc - process-based network monitoring tool
SYNOPSIS
  netproc [-B] [-c] [-f [filename]] [-h] [-i iface] [-n] [-p udp | tcp] [-v]
          [--si]
DESCRIPTION
  netproc monitors network traffic and tries to find out which process
  this traffic belongs to, this is useful to quickly know who is consuming
  our network resources.

  netproc currently supports the TCP and UDP protocols over the IPv4 protocol.

OPTIONS
  -B, --bytes             view in bytes, default in bits
  -c                      visualization each active connection of the process
  --color 1|2|3           color scheme, 1 is default
  -f, --file "filename"   save statistics in file, filename is optional,
                        default is 'netproc.log'
  -h, --help              show this message
  -i, --interface iface   specifies an interface, default is all
                        (except interface with network 127.0.0.0/8)
  -n                      numeric host and service, implicit '-c', try '-nh' to no
                        translate only host or '-np' to not translate only service
  -p, --protocol tcp|udp  specifies a protocol, the default is tcp and udp
  --si                    show SI format, with powers of 1000, default is IEC,
                        with powers of 1024
  -v, --verbose           verbose mode, also show process without traffic
  -V, --version           show version

RUNNING CONTROL

  arrow keys    scroll
  s             change column-based sort
  q             exit

EXAMPLES
  This command will display the ips / ports of the udp traffic of the processes,
  monitoring all available interfaces, except the loopback, and log a summary
  in the file "log.txt":

    # netproc -p udp -c -f "log.txt"

  Useful to monitor the file generated in the above command:

    $ watch -t -d 'cat log.txt'
    $ watch -t 'cut -c -$COLUMNS log.txt'

  Running whitout root:

    $ sudo setcap "cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw+pe" /usr/local/sbin/netproc
    $ export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/sbin
